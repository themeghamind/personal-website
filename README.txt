hello! I am currently building my personal website :)

it's mostly plain HTML with a sprinkle of CSS but the design decisions are taking quite long. 
Who am I? If I were a website, what would that look like?
Anywho, let me know what you think if you stumble across this.

Psttt... which font is better: 1) Cutive Mono, 2) Sorts Mill Goudy, 3) Baskervville, 4) Cormorant
